number= 5
print(number)               # Where print is the "Function/Method/Procedure" and inside bracket is called "Parameter or Arguments"
print(type(number))         # there are many inbuilt Functions in all languages. we can Google it. 
long_number= 38937483949000
print(long_number)

# Decimal form   ---> which is normal numbers that we are using eg: 0,1,2,3,4,.....

# Binary form  --> this is 0s asd 1s  ---> we can specify this as 0b or 0B  
no= 0b1011
print(no)
no1=0B1011
